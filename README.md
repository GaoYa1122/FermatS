# FermatS
A novel numerical representation for protein sequence comparison and DNA-binding protein identification.
# data
There are four data sets: nine_species, DNAdset, DNAiset and DNArset, that can get from the data folder. Among them, "nine_species" is used for similarity analysis, "DNAdset" is used for establishing the prediction model of DNA binding protein recognition, "DNAiset" and "DNArset" are used for testing model.
# method
You must to install Matlab, R3.7 and python3 or above. The file name contains the purpose of the file. They are used for drawing, structural features, modeling and evaluation.
